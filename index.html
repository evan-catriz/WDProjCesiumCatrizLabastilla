                    <p id="waes-info">Endangered species are any species that is at risk of extinction because of a rapid decrease in its population or a loss of its critical habitat.
                        The main causes for animal endangerment include habitat loss, rapidly altering environments, pollution, and poaching.</p>

                <div class="cont2">
                    <p>According to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), there are <b>over 48,600 species currently threatened with extinction worldwide</b>, but over 1,000,000 are projected to be at risk of extinction in the next few decades.
                        These include 27% of t
                      he world’s mammals, 41% of amphibians, 37% of sharks and rays, and 21% of reptiles.
                        For this website, we will be focusing primarily on animal species. </p>

                    <p id="loer"><b>Levels of Extinction Risk:</b></p>
                    <p> There are nine main levels for classifying species by extinction risk, established by the IUCN Red List, ranging from "Least Concern" (lowest risk) to "Extinct" (gone forever), with Vulnerable, Endangered, and Critically Endangered being the official "threatened" levels, indicating increasing risk from high to extremely high extinction potential.
                        </p>

                <div class="cont4">
                <p>Least Concern (LC): Widespread and abundant; not currently at risk.<br>
                    Near Threatened (NT): Close to qualifying for a threatened category soon.<br>
                    Vulnerable (VU): High risk of endangerment in the wild.<br>
                    Endangered (EN): Very high risk of extinction in the near future.<br>
                    Critically Endangered (CR): Extremely high risk of extinction in the immediate future.<br>
                    Extinct in the Wild (EW): Survives only in captivity or as naturalized populations outside its historic range.<br>
                    Extinct (EX): No known individuals remain. <br></p>

                <p id="wbd"><b>What's being done:</b></p>
                <p>The Endangered Species Act (ESA), enacted in 1973 and credited with being the world's strongest conservation law, has saved 99% of listed species from extinction. It currently protects around 1,700 domestic and 1,700 foreign species. To qualify for ESA protections, a species must first be listed under the law as either endangered or threatened. Recovery plans (road map for species recovery) are being developed everyday by organizations such as NOAA Fisheries. Private and nonprofit entities and individuals also take actions to recover species because they share a goal of preserving biodiversity, or because they have an interest in seeing the species delisted.
