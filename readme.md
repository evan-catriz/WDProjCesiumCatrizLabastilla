## Title & Subtitle: Nature on the edge: A complete guide to the endangered species of the Philippines

## Description of the Website
This webpage aims to bring more information to the top five most endangered species in the Philippine Islands. It also helps bring light to the challenges they face when it comes to thriving in the ecosystem (internal or external) and also how we are their main hope when it comes to survival. We used this topic because it is really interesting to us and since endangered species need to be more recognized as these contribute to the diversity of the ecosystem of the Philippines. This webpage hopes to spread more awareness about the current situation of some of our native species on the brink of extinction and to help or support organizations that focus on taking care of these endangered species, and that there is more to this problem than just their forever disappearance.

## Javascript Usage on Website
Interactive Map: <br>
In our website, we will use an interactive map as our directory to each of the endangered species, with points in their general location. We will use Javascript to make it so that when you click on the buttons, a small in-web "window" will pop up containing a photo and some general and short information on the species with a smooth "enlarge" appearance, and will smoothly zoom out when closed. There will also be a button that says "Read more" at the bottom which, when clicked, will direct them to the actual content with all of the information on the species. <br>
<br>
Webpage Transition: <br>
We will use Javascript to make smoother transitions for each page of our website. We will use this so that the user has a more neat, clean, and smooth time navigating with each of the contents that the website can give. It is also for pleasing and aesthetic effect wherein it has a fade in/out transition for a fluid and seamless effect. <br>
<br>
Gallery: <br>
The website will feature a gallery that contains photos of each endangered species. The photos, seperated by species, will be shown via a carousel effect using Javascript. This avoids overwhelming the user with too many visuals and makes it easier to appreciate each image individually and makes a more smooth and story-telling interface, like flipping through a book.
