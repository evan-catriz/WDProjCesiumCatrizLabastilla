## Title & Subtitle: Nature on the edge: A complete guide to the endangered species of the Philippines

## Description of the Website
This webpage aims to bring more information to the top five most endangered species in the Philippine Islands. It also helps bring light to the challenges they face when it comes to thriving in the ecosystem (internal or external) and also how we are their main hope when it comes to survival. We used this topic because it is really interesting to us and since endangered species need to be more recognized as these contribute to the diversity of the ecosystem of the Philippines. This webpage hopes to spread more awareness about the current situation of some of our native species on the brink of extinction and to help or support organizations that focus on taking care of these endangered species, and that there is more to this problem than just their forever disappearance.

## Javascript Usage on Website
Interactive Map: <br>
In our website, we will use an interactive map as our directory to each of the endangered species, with points in their general location. We will use Javascript to make it so that when you click on the buttons, a small in-web "window" will pop up containing a photo and some general and short information on the species with a smooth "enlarge" appearance, and will smoothly zoom out when closed. There will also be a button that says "Read more" at the bottom which, when clicked, will direct them to the actual content with all of the information on the species. <br>
<br>
Webpage Transition: <br>
We will use Javascript to make smoother transitions for each page of our website. We will use this so that the user has a more neat, clean, and smooth time navigating with each of the contents that the website can give. It is also for pleasing and aesthetic effect wherein it has a fade in/out transition for a fluid and seamless effect. <br>
<br>
Gallery: <br>
The website will feature a gallery that contains photos of each endangered species. The photos, seperated by species, will be shown via a carousel effect using Javascript. This avoids overwhelming the user with too many visuals and makes it easier to appreciate each image individually and makes a more smooth and story-telling interface, like flipping through a book.

## Design and Narrative on HTML Form

HTML form to be used on the website: Quiz game. The webpage will allow the user to test their knowledge regarding the contents of the website by having them take an online quiz regarding all that was mentioned in the previous webpages. It will first ask for the user’s name in order to keep track of the leaderboard, then 10 questions regarding endangered animals will be asked of the user. A different set of questions will be asked every time the webpage is reloaded. <br><br>

Users will then be redirected to a “Thank you” page showing their score and their place on the leaderboard compared to other people who played the game. This will be accompanied by a fun fact about endangered animals that will change every time the quiz will be taken. This is to allow people to participate more actively in the goals of environmental campaigns by creating a fun and interactive way for people to gain knowledge and spread awareness. <br><br>

An additional webpage will also appear only when the user fills out the form in the first webpage, showing a timeline of environmental conservation efforts, interactive statistics/charts, and additional information on all the organizations displayed in the “Next Steps” webpage. All webpages will incorporate the use of input tag, select tag, option tag, and button tag.<br><br>

### Test Your Knowledge
This webpage will display an interactive quiz featuring true/false, multiple choice, and identification questions regarding the endangered animals showcased in the website. They will first be asked to input their name, after which they will be given a random set of questions out of 40 questions that will be made. They may take the quiz as many times as they want.

### Score
This will display the user’s score in the quiz, their place on the leaderboard, and a randomly generated endangered animal fact. It will also show the user what new features they’ve unlocked based on their score in the quiz. A score of 2 will unlock one part of the environmental conservation timeline, a score of 4 will unlock a part of the timeline and one interactive chart, and so on.

### Extra Privileges
This webpage will only unlock once the user has filled out the quiz at least once, and it contains extra information regarding endangered animals, such as a timeline of environmental conservation efforts around the world, multiple links to animated charts that the user can search up at any time, and a detailed explanation of the environmental awareness organizations.
