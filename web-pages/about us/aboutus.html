                <p>This website aims to bring more information to various endangered species in the Philippine Islands. It also helps bring light to the challenges they face when it comes to thriving in the ecosystem (internal or external) and also how we are their main hope when it comes to survival. It is essential for these endangered species to be more recognized as they contribute to the diversity of our ecosystem. We hope to spread more awareness about the current situation of some of our native species on the brink of extinction and to help or support organizations that focus on taking care of these endangered species, and that there is more to this issue than just their permanent disappearance.</p>

                    I’m Himig, a Batch 2029 student from Philippine Science High School. I’m an avid fantasy reader and Studio Ghibli enthusiast whose favorite pastimes include arts & crafts, swimming, and badminton. With both parents working in environment and sociology oriented careers, I was exposed to the need for global action regarding environmental issues at a young age. Plenty of my relatives who are active in social events have inspired me to look at the world through a deeper lens, urging me to see the root of our problems. With this website, I aim to instill change not just around the world, but within people’s minds..</p>

                    I’m Evan, a Batch 2029 student from Philippine Science High School. I’m a pianist and a gamer who likes coding, abstract art (since that’s all I can do when it comes to art), football, and badminton. When I was young, I was introduced to the struggles of nature from watching news and educational videos of endangered and extinct species. As someone who values every bit of what makes up the ecosystem of the Philippines, I was inspired to spread awareness about what our native species are going through. I hope that through this website, I can help make people aware of the current situation of our natural environment, and inspire many to make changes for the better.</p>
