                <p>
                    Did you know?<br>
We are currently living through the world's sixth mass extinction. This is a rare event wherein at least 75% of all living species on Earth die out within a relatively short period of time. Factors such as climate change have only further contributed to the rapid decline of our ecosystems. Soon enough, it will not only be the plant and animal species suffering, but humanity as well.
